		<h4><a name='equivalents'> </a>Method of discovering unseen translation equivalents in comparable corpora</h4>
		<p>
		Frequently multiword expressions cannot be translated literally, word-for-word, and in many cases their translation equivalents cannot 
		be found in dictionaries or parallel corpora. A method is proposed for discovering such non-literal translation equivalents for 
		multiword expressions in non-parallel, or comparable corpora (collections of documents in the same subject domain and genre). 
		In the first stage, a set of distributionally similar synonyms is produced for each word in a multiword expression; 
		then the word and each of the synonyms are translated into the target language using a traditional dictionary, and distributionally 
		similar synonyms are generated for each of the translations. In the next stage, all possible combinations (a Cartesian product) 
		of these translations and synonyms for each word in a multiword expression are generated. Usually there is a large number of such 
		possibilities. Each of them is tested for being a possible collocation in the target language corpus, and those candidates which pass 
		this test are ranked by the degree of their distributional similarity to the original expression. The method generates N-best list 
		of candidates, which was found useful by human translators for finding non-literal solutions to hard translation problems. 
		Formal evaluation confirmed that the method outperforms searches in parallel corpora using word alignment tools, such as Giza++, 
		in terms of a range of suggested translation equivalents. The method models strategies of paraphrasing and synonymous
		translation used by human translators, which allows to generate new, previously unseen translation equivalents.

		<h4><a name='comparability'> </a>Methods of measuring comparability of multilingual documents/corpora and evaluating comparability metrics</h4>
		<p>
		For many computational linguistic applications it is important to understand the degree of closeness, or comparability 
		between documents or larger document collections. Several methods have been suggested, including methods of mapping words
		across languages using dictionaries or an on-line machine translation system, and then computing comparability scores on 
		the basis of combining several lexical and structural features. As the intuitive notion of comparability is not well-defined,
		it is difficult to interpret and/or evaluate different types of comparability scores. Methods developed here are based on measuring
		Pearson's correlation between values of the scores computed on different types of texts and independent comparabiltiy benchmarks, e.g., 
		a baseline intuitive human judgements about the degree of closeness between the texts. However, a more promissing benchmark is 
		a performance-based indicator: the number of transaltion equivalents which can be successfully extracted from comparable documents.
		Proposed measures showed high correlation between computed comparability scores and the average numbers of extracted translation 
		equivalents, which creates a new technical task-based definition of comparability.</p>
		<p>
		Another method for evaluating the quality of comparability metrics is based on metric's consistency across languages:
		Comparability scores are computed between monolingual documents on the source and target side. Then correlation is computed between
		theser ranges, and the best metrics is the most consistent one -- yielding the highest correlation.

		<h4><a name='mtie'> </a>Improving Machine Translation quality with Information Extraction techniques</h4>
		<p>
		The quality of Machine Translation of texts which contain proper names can be improved by pre-processing source texts with 
		Information Extraction tools, such as Named Entity recognition systems. MT can take full advantage of this annotation if it is 
		fully-integrated into MT architecture. The improvements in translation quality take place both inside annotated named entities, 
		and in their sentential context, since the annotation often improves segmentation of the sentences. These experiments point to the 
		potential of Information Extraction techniques for improving translation quality of MT systems.

		<h4><a name='mteval'> </a>MT evaluation: improving accuracy of automated MT evaluation metrics and characterising their applicability and limitations</h4>
		<p>
		Automted MT evaluation methods are based on either measuring distance between MT output and the source text (or MT output and a 
		gold-standard human translation) -- so called reference proximity methods, (which include BLEU, NIST, Meteor, TER, etc); or on 
		measuring performance of certain automated systems and tasks, such as parsing, Information Extraction, Named Entity recognition, 
		text mining -- from MT output, and comparing it with systems' performance on human translations or original source texts -- 
		so called performance-based methods. </p>
		
		<p> 
		For proximity-based methods such as BLEU, correlation with human intuitive judgements on Adequacy and Fluency of translation can be 
		improved if matched words in the MT output and the gold-standard human translation are weighted by their statistical salience in target 
		texts, e.g., using 	measures such as FT.IDF, S-scores which are typically used in Information Retrieval. </p>
		
		<p>
		It is important to understand limitations for using different types of automated MT evaluation metrics for different evaluation tasks. 
		Proximity-based methods produce reliable correlation with human judgements if the size of evaluated output is more than ~7000 words. 
		When automated methods are used for comparing different versions of the same system developed over time, correlation is usually 
		reliable across different target languages and text types; when they are used for predicting human evaluation scores on the basis 
		of automated scores, or for assessing whether MT output is fit for purpose (i.e., if MT reaches a certain quality threshold), then 
		the regression parameters (the slope and intercept) are different for different target languages and text types, so automated scores 
		need re-calibration with human evaluation for each new combination of a target language and text type (subject domain, genre). 
		Proximity-based metrics usually loose sensitivity on higher-quality MT output, e.g, for MT between closely-related languages, such as 
		Russian and Ukrainian, where lexical level is already properly covered, and other higher-level quality parameters matter more: 
		discourse coherence, appropriateness of the style. 	Performance-based metrics are more stable across different quality levels of 
		evaluated texts. This can be interpreted as a difference between evaluation on a structural level for proximity-based metrics, and on 
		functional level for performance-based metrics, which capture system's performance on the level of text-external functions.

		<h4><a name='mterror'> </a>A methodology of automated error analysis for MT</h4>
		<p>
		Automated evaluation metrics, such as BLEU produce reliable results on test sets about 7000 words or more, so their application 
		for document-level or sentence-level evaluation is limited: lexical mismatches can be interpreted either as MT errors, or as a result 
		of legitimate variation in translation. For this reason it is also difficult to use automated metrics for identification and analysis 
		of indivudual errors in MT. A method of automated error analysis is proposed, which allows to benchmark translation quality for  
		individual multiword expressions and linguistic constructions, and to rank the importance these expression for MT development 
		workflow using a risk-assessment framework. The framework highlights most frequent constructions which have lowest evaluation scores 
		that need to receive highest priority to be covered. The method is based on extracting a large set of multiword expressions, terms and 
		constructions whose	quality is checked in the error analysis. Then concordance lines within a limited window (up to 5 words) are 
		generated for each of these expressions using an aligned parallel corpus. For each of the expressions these concordances are 
		treated as an evaluation corpus. Empirically it was established that BLEU-type scores for these concordances reflect translation 
		quality of evaluated constructions, so BLEU scores have a specific 'island of stability' on much smaller sizes of evaluated data, 
		if those are generated in a contolled way -- as concordances with a narrow context window.

		<h4><a name='wovariation'> </a>A Tree Adjoining Grammar-based model of word order variation in Ukrainian</h4>
		<p>
		Limitations on comprehensibility of centre-embedded sentences are often illustrated by examples such as 
		'The rat the cat the dog chased killed ate the malt. (Chomsky & Miller, 1963, p. 286)', where a sentence with two levels of 
		centre embedding becomes incomprehensible: cf. 'The rat the cat killed ate the malt.': one level of centre embedding, the sentence 
		is still comprehensible. Traditional expanation for this limitation is insufficient size of human short-term memory for processing 
		sentences which otherwise are grammatically well-formed. However, in Ukrainian and other languages with morphological case marking 
		there are other types of centre embedded constructions which remain comprehensible up to 4 levels of centre embedding, that is consistent 
		with Yngve's model on limitations of short-term memory for linguistic processing, and other psychological evidence, where the limit 
		is 7[plus/minus]2 units (assuming that 1 level of embeddign consumes 2 memory units). However, embedding of subordinate clauses in object position 
		still become incomprehensible in Ukrainian starting from 2 levels of centre embedding. A morphosyntactic model is proposed based on 
		the formalism of tree adjoining grammars enhanced with morphological features and word order variation constraints, which 
		accounts for limits of comprehensibility of different types of centre-embedded linguistic constructions across languages. Specifically, 
		for 2-level centre embedded clauses in object position morphological case features clash at a certain point in proposed syntactic 
		representation, which does not happen in other types of constructions that allow higher levels of centre embedding. The model allows 
		us to predict grammatical limits on comprehensibility of sentences, and to understand the nature of psychological comprehensibility 
		of linguistic construction -- the pheonomenon which is different from ungrammaticality when a sentence still remains comprehensible, 
		even though not well-formed. This model can be used for establishing limitations of comprehesibility of automatically generated text, 
		e.g., the output of Machine Translation systems.

		<h4><a name='representations'> </a>Systems of syntaxeme groups: a semantically-oriented formalism for syntactic representations</h4>
		<p>
		Present linguistic formalisms give no clear way of integrating semantic and syntactic representations within the same descriptive 
		framework. Syntactic relations are normally interpreted in semantic terms, can be paraphrased lexically and contribute to a general 
		semantic content of sentences. A new formalism for semantic-level description of syntactic representation is proposed -- systems of 
		syntaxeme groups -- that integrate meanings expressed lexically and syntactically. The formalism can be used to compute semantic 
		effect of a text on an ontological model of a subject domain that represents speakers' knowledge about a communicative situation.

		<h4><a name='diphtongs'> </a>History of diphthongs in Ukrainian Northern dialects: system coherency method as evidence for later origin of Northern diphtongs</h4>
		<p>
		A distictive feature of Ukrianian phonological system is the sound [i] in newly-closed syllables, in place of [o] and [e], which 
		has lead to known historical vowel alternations: [st'il] (table.Nom) vs. [stola] (of table.Gen); [selo](vilage.Nom.Sing) vs. 
		[s'il](of villages.Gen.Plur) -- [i] appeared where the syllable closed because of the decline of reduced vovels [o] and [e] 
		at the end of the following syllable, and short [o]/[e] vocalised into full vowels where the syllable remained open. This process 
		in Ukrainian happened around 14th century. According to a hypothesis of Franz Miklosic it happened through the stage when [o] and [e] 
		became long vowels, then diphtongs and then transformed into the present [i] sound. Miklosic believed that the remnants of these 
		diphtongs remain in Ukrainian Northern dialects: [stuol](table.Nom). However, other linguistics, such as Volodymyr Hantsov and 
		Olena Kurylo challenaged this view: according to them Northern Ukrainian diphtongs are relatively new feature, and are not 
		related to the history of the transformation of /o, e/ into /i/ in the rest of the Ukrianian dialects. The argument was that diphtongisation
		is stress dependednt in the North, which does not fit Miklosic's model. In a research project which was based on a field trip to a 
		Northern Ukrainian village of Pidlisne (former Tserkovyshche), Kozelets district of the Chernihiv region new data was recorded that 
		adds weight to this alternative hypothesis by Hantsov and Kurylo. More specifically, diphtongs were found in words such as 
		/muozh/ (Standard Ukr. /muzh/ - 'man', hist. /monzh/, with nasalised /on/), /hariechyj/ (Standard Ukr. /har'achyj/ - 'hot', 
		hist. /harenchyj/, with nasalised /en/), i.e., not in positions where they shold not be 
		according to Miklosic's model. In the proposed research these diphtongs are explained by relating them to another feature of the 
		Northern dialects: de-nasalisation of nasal vowels: /pamet'/ (Standard Ukr. /pamjat'/ - 'memory') -- from /pament'/ (with nasal /en/).
		Diphtongs in /muozh/ and /hariechyj/ appered after nasalised vowels /en, /on/ lost their nasal component in Northern dialects
		and became undistinguishable from historic non-nasalised /e/ and /o/. But in the Southern dialects /en/ and /on/ already behaved 
		differently -- they transformed into /ja/, /ju/ -- respectively. This indicated that at that stage phonological systems of Northern 
		and Southern Ukrainian dialects were separated and worked independently. So subsequent transformation of 
		/o, e/ into /i/ in the South (which later became the basis of Standard Ukrinian) and /o, e/ into diphtongs /uo/, /ie/ in the North --
		were independent processes, so Northern diphtongs are a relatively new phenomenon and could not be treated as a preserved intermediate 
		stage of the same process of all-Ukrainian change in the vowel system, as Miklosic thought. This result shows that understanding 
		of historic changes in a language can benefit from taking into account several seemingly unrelated phenomena, and understanding their 
		function as parts of a coherent and interdependent linguistic system which function not only on the synchrony level, but also 
		maintains its coherence over time -- usually spanning across several centuries, and geographically -- spanning across relatively distant 
		territories.

		<h4><a name='logicalconnectives'> </a>Pragmatics of logical connectives: scalar implicature model for conversational semantics of 'if', 'or' &amp; 'and'</h4>
		<p>
		Logical connectives, such as 'and', 'or', 'if' in their everyday use often have usages which go beyond their standard truth-conditional 
		meanings: 'and' is often used with an additional temporal meaning 'and then'; 'or' is used as an exclusive 'or', not allowing 
		two conjoint propositions to be true for the whole combined sentence to be true; 'if' is used in a sense 'if and only if'. 
		In Gracean Pragmatics these phenomena are traditionally explained as 'conventional implicatures' -- additions to meanings that 
		are part of linguistic convention shared by speakers, which still can be challenged in conversation. The problem is that this 
		explanation is not systematic and has to deal with meanings for each indivudual connective. A new model is proposed which 
		characterises deviations from standard truth-conditional values of logical connectives as 'scalar implicature' -- additional part 
		of meaning that arises from systematic relations between elements of the linguistic systems which are measured against some kind of 
		scale. The scales operate over 'shared domains' of the connectives -- parts of the truth tables where these connectives have the same 
		truth values. This model allows us to predict systematic changes in meanings of all logical connectives as part of a single explanatory 
		system. This model predicts a linguistic potential for systematic changes in conversational 'implicature' meanings of connecties.
